# CT Image SuperResolution with Deep Learning
### NeuroEngineering Project Workshop 2021/2022 @ Politecnico di Milano
*Supervisors: Prof. Pietro Cerveri, PhD; Matteo Rossi, PhD*
***
A Deep Learning model for superresolution of CT Images. This superresolution task consists in combining denoising and increasing spatial extent

**Input:** 128x128x64 low-res CT-scans, with superimposed gaussian noise
**Output:**  256x256x64 high-res CT-scans, denoised
